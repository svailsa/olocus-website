# **Olocus: Distributed Trust Infrastructure**

## Executive Summary

Olocus is a decentralised protocol that leverages passive location tracking and physical co-signing to create cryptographically verifiable proofs of human behaviours and relationships, forming a portable trust graph that serves as foundational infrastructure for identity, reputation, and commerce in the digital age.

At its core, Olocus recognises that physical co-presence is the most complex signal to fake at scale. By enabling users to verify each other's locations during real-world interactions mutually, we build a web of authenticated relationships that transcends platform silos. Users own and monetise their data through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), earning passive income while maintaining complete privacy—no raw data ever leaves their device.

Olocus isn't just another data app; it's a paradigm shift in how we approach trust infrastructure. As a Community Interest Company, we're building for the long term—prioritising user sovereignty, privacy, and genuine social value over rapid extraction. **This is a 10-year journey to 2-5 million users, generating £43-97 million in annual revenue with 60-70% margins at maturity**, built with a sustainable and ethical approach that creates genuine public good.

Our distributed architecture enables exceptional unit economics: users own their data on-device, buyers fund user rewards directly through the marketplace (not from our revenue), and a lean protocol-focused organisation (45 people at 1M users vs 100+ for traditional tech companies) keeps costs low. At 1 million users, we project £43 million annual revenue with £26 million profit (60% margin)—demonstrating that privacy-respecting, user-sovereign business models can be highly profitable.

We're seeking impact-oriented investors and strategic partners who understand that building foundational infrastructure takes time. Join us in creating an open, user-sovereign protocol that empowers individuals while generating sustainable returns through genuine value creation, not surveillance capitalism.

**p.s.** "Olocus" is a neologism created by blending "open" (for open source) and the Latin word "locus" (meaning "place" or "location").

## The Core Problem and Our Solution

In a world where digital interactions dominate, trust is fractured. Centralised platforms like Facebook and Google hoard social graphs, data brokers sell unverified insights with 60-70% accuracy, and Web3 struggles with Sybil attacks and unproven identities. Regulatory pressures (GDPR, CCPA, age verification mandates in the UK/EU/US) demand better privacy-preserving verification, yet solutions remain siloed or surveillance-heavy.

Olocus solves this by turning everyday physical interactions into verifiable digital assets. Users' mobile devices maintain private hash chains of location data, anchored daily to a blockchain for timestamping. Co-signing—mutual verification during co-presence—strengthens the graph, creating multi-layered proofs that are resistant to fraud (targeting 92-95% accuracy achieved via GPS, WiFi, behavioural heuristics, and social validation). We address fraud vectors such as single-user multiple devices, coordinated fraud rings, and GPS spoofing through device fingerprinting, behavioural heuristics, economic disincentives, location cross-validation, graph analysis, and device integrity checks, targeting 5-8% fraudulent proofs at scale.

The result: A universal, portable trust graph where users control their data, buyers access verified insights via ZKPs, and developers build on composable primitives. This shifts value from intermediaries (who extract £2-5 per user annually) back to individuals, fostering a more equitable data economy.

## Value Propositions

### For Individual Users

- **Data Sovereignty:** Own and control data with on-device storage and ZKPs.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Passive tracking delivers personalised analytics on time allocation, activity patterns, and sustainability metrics—think Gyroscope or RescueTime, but users (optionally) get paid instead of paying.  
- **Personal Security:** Immutable location history acts as a digital alibi for legal, insurance, or personal needs.  
- **Portable Reputation:** Cryptographically proven relationships and behaviours become user-owned assets, usable across platforms for better opportunities in dating, jobs, or finance.  
- **Realistic Earnings:** Sell ZKPs of behaviours (e.g., gym habits, eco-friendly commutes) for £20-60/year in passive income, with no ongoing effort beyond occasional co-signing. Power users with high-value verified behaviours can earn £200-400/year.

### For Buyers (Brands, Researchers, Platforms)

- **Superior Data Quality:** Access proven behaviours (e.g., "gym 4x/week for 90 days") with 92-95% accuracy, outperforming self-reported (70% accuracy) or inferred data (60-80% accuracy), with confidence scores and fraud detection built in.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** ZKPs provide answers without PII, future-proofing against privacy laws.  
- **Cost-Effective Targeting:** Verified audiences at £8-20/user/year (premium over data brokers at £2-5/year, but far cheaper than background checks at £30-100).  
- **Built-in Fraud Protection:** Layered verification with 5-8% fraud rate (vs 15-30% for self-reported), building buyer confidence.

### For Developers and Integrators

- **Ready-Made Infrastructure:** APIs for Sybil resistance, social recovery, reputation scoring—solving cold-start problems in social apps.  
- **Interoperability:** Standardised queries enable seamless integration, akin to Stripe for payments or Plaid for banking.  
- **Ecosystem Growth:** Build on an existing graph, compounding value through composability.

### For Society at Large

- **Economic Empowerment:** Individuals capture data value directly, disrupting the £100B+ data broker industry.  
- **Privacy-First Innovation:** Proves that monetisation and privacy can coexist, reducing surveillance capitalism.  
- **Open Access:** An auditable, forkable protocol creates a public good, preventing new monopolies.  
- **Long-Term Sustainability:** CIC structure ensures mission alignment for decades, not just until acquisition.

## Network Effects: The Flywheel

Olocus is designed for compounding growth over 8-10 years:

- **User Density Drives Value:** More users mean stronger verifications, higher earnings, and better privacy (larger anonymity sets).  
- **Viral Loops:** Co-signing boosts mutual earnings; communities (gyms, clubs) adopt en masse.  
- **Developer Pull:** Apps integrating Olocus attract users seeking portable trust, creating a moat.  
- **Buyer-User Symbiosis:** Verified audiences draw premium buyers, increasing payouts and user acquisition.  
- **Data Improvement:** Scale enhances graph density and fraud detection, justifying higher pricing.

This mirrors LinkedIn's graph dominance but with openness and user ownership. Critical mass (500K-1M users) establishes first-mover advantage. **Realistic timeline: 7-10 years to critical mass.**

## Cold Start Survival Strategy

To address the network effects chicken-and-egg problem, we employ a staged value proposition:

### Phase 0: MVP (0-500users, Months 1-6)

Bootstrapped by VSPRY, CEO and CIO

- First 100-500 users from friends, family, and direct network  
- Focus: Validate core UX and battery impact tolerance  
- Investment: £0 external capital, founders' time only

### Phase 1: Standalone Value (500-5K users, Months 6-18)

Provide immediate value without co-signing:

- **Life-Logging Journal:** Automatic location diary, carbon footprint tracking (free, comparable to Gyroscope at £15/month).  
- **Freemium Analytics:** Time allocation charts, summaries (3-5% premium conversion at £7/month).  
- **Personal Security Archive:** Immutable timestamps for legal needs.

**Target metrics:**

- 35% D30 retention  
- Revenue £25-50K/year from premiums  
- Proof of concept for location tracking acceptance

**Reality check:** A daily battery drain of 8-10% may limit early adopters to power users and privacy advocates. This is acceptable for Phase 1\.

### Phase 2: Subsidised Marketplace (5K-75K users, Months 18-48)

Bootstrap demand:

- **Pilot programs:** 10-20 buyers with subsidized data access (£5K-10K per pilot)  
- **Curated cohorts:** Recruit gym-goers, commuters, event enthusiasts (£20-50K in incentives over 30 months)  
- **Co-signing bootstrap:** "Bring a Friend" bonuses (£10 each), gym partnerships (£500/month per gym)

**Target metrics:**

- 12-15% weekly active users  
- 20-25% with 1+ co-signs  
- 10-15 paying buyers  
- Revenue £300K-800K/year  
- Still burning cash, but the path to profitability is visible

### Phase 3: Emerging Network Effects (75K-300K users, Years 4-7)

Flywheel begins to activate:

- City density enables natural co-signing in 2-3 metro areas  
- Subsidies can be reduced gradually  
- Geographic expansion to 5-10 cities  
- Developer ecosystem begins (5-10 integrated apps)

**Target metrics:**

- 25-30% weekly active users  
- 40-50% with 5+ co-signs  
- 100-200 paying buyers  
- Revenue £6-15M/year  
- **Approaching profitability** (break-even at 200-250K users)

### Phase 4: Sustainable Growth (300K-1M users, Years 7-10)

Network effects drive organic growth:

- Word-of-mouth becomes primary acquisition  
- Premium conversion improves (5-8%)  
- API revenue scales with developer adoption  
- International expansion

**Target metrics:**

- 35-40% weekly active users  
- 60-70% with 10+ co-signs  
- 500+ paying buyers  
- Revenue £25-43M/year  
- **Highly profitable** (50-60% margins)

**This is an 8-10 year journey to product-market fit and profitability,** comparable to Plaid (7 years to profitability), Stripe (5 years), or Signal (ongoing nonprofit model).

## Commercial Structure and Financials

### Entity and Governance

#### Legal Structure: Community Interest Company (CIC)

Olocus will be incorporated as a UK Community Interest Company, ensuring mission alignment and community benefit:

**Why CIC:**

- **Mission-locked:** Community benefit is legally mandated, cannot pivot to pure profit extraction  
- **Asset lock:** Prevents asset stripping or mission drift  
- **Investment-friendly:** Can raise capital and issue shares like a normal company  
- **Dividend capability:** Up to 35% of profits can be distributed to shareholders  
- **Credibility:** Signals long-term commitment to users and privacy  
- **Flexibility:** More agile than charities, more credible than pure for-profits  
- **Patient capital attraction:** Appeals to impact investors, ethical funds, strategic corporates

**Geographic Neutrality:** The UK jurisdiction provides an excellent legal framework for EU, Australian, and North American operations, with strong IP protection and alignment with privacy laws.

**Investment Philosophy:** We seek partners who understand that foundational infrastructure requires patience and perseverance. This is not a "flip in 5 years" opportunity—it's a 10- to 15-year commitment to building genuine public good that happens to be highly profitable at scale.

### Financial Policies

#### **Dividend Policy**

**CIC Legal Limit:** Maximum 35% of distributable profits

**Olocus Target Policy:**

- **Target payout ratio:** 10-15% of distributable profits (well within 35% cap)  
- **Priority 1:** Reinvestment in protocol development (55-65% of profits)  
- **Priority 2:** Community benefit activities (20-30% of profits)  
- **Priority 3:** Shareholder dividends (10-15% of profits)

**Expectations:**

- Years 1-5: No dividends (reinvestment phase)  
- Years 6-8: Modest dividends as profitability emerges (3-5% yield on invested capital)  
- Years 9+: Meaningful dividends (8-12% yield) once sustainable profitability is achieved

**Decision-Making:**

- Board recommends dividend annually  
- Requires special resolution (75% shareholder approval)  
- Cannot exceed 35% without CIC Regulator approval (which won't be granted)

**Investor Expectations:** Primary returns via three mechanisms:

1. **Long-term dividends:** 8-12% annual yield at maturity (Years 10+)  
2. **Strategic acquisition exit:** 2-3x revenue multiple, with CIC-compliant structure  
3. **Potential governance token:** User/shareholder allocation in future decentralisation phase

**Realistic ROI Timeline:** 10-15 years to 3-5x return on invested capital

#### **CIC Regulatory Compliance**

**Required Annual Reporting:**

- CIC Report to Regulator (detailing community benefit activities)  
- Financial statements filed with Companies House  
- Confirmation of compliance with asset lock  
- Report on dividends and profit distribution

**Public Disclosure:**

#### **Governance Transparency**

**Open Protocol Development:**

- RFC (Request for Comments) process for significant protocol changes  
- Public GitHub repositories for all core IP  
- Community input periods before finalising specifications  
- Regular developer community calls (monthly)

**User Privacy:**

- Annual third-party privacy audit  
- Public disclosure of any data breaches (GDPR requirement)  
- Transparency reports on government/legal requests  
- User-accessible logs of what data is collected and how it's used

### Exit and Liquidity Provisions

#### **Potential Exit Mechanisms (Ethical Investment Focus)**

**Our Philosophy:** We're building for permanence, not exit. However, we recognise investors need liquidity. Our approach strikes a balance between preserving the mission and achieving fair returns.

**1\. Long-Term Dividend Stream (Primary Return Mechanism)**

- Years 6-8: Initial dividends begin (3-5% yield)  
- Years 9-15: Meaningful dividends (8-12% yield)  
- Years 15+: Mature dividend stream (10-15% yield)  
- **Target cumulative return:** 3-5x invested capital over 15 years via dividends alone  
- **Advantage:** Doesn't require selling the company, preserves the mission

**2\. Strategic Acquisition (Secondary Mechanism)**

- Target valuation: 2-3x annual revenue (modest multiple reflects CIC constraints)  
- Example: £60-90M at £30M revenue (500K users, Year 8\)  
- Example: £86-129M at £43M revenue (1M users, Year 10\)  
- Buyers: Privacy-focused tech companies, decentralised infrastructure players, impact-driven corporates  
- **Requirements:**  
  - Buyer must maintain the community benefit mission  
  - Independent valuation required (CIC asset lock)  
  - CIC Regulator approval  
  - Buyer will maintain protocol as an open-source public good  
- Timeline: 8-12 years from formation  
- **Advantage:** Earlier liquidity for investors, if the right buyer emerges

**3\. Governance Token Launch (Tertiary Mechanism)**

- Olocus Governance Token for protocol decisions  
- Shareholders receive proportional token allocation  
- Provides partial liquidity without selling the company  
- Timeline: 5-8 years, after 200K+ users  
- **Advantage:** Aligns with decentralisation mission, creates additional value

**4\. Secondary Share Sales**

- Right of first refusal to the company/founders  
- Board approval required for transfers  
- Independent valuation required (CIC asset lock)  
- Limited liquidity, but provides some flexibility

#### **Asset Lock Implications for Exits**

**CIC Asset Lock Rules:**

- Cannot sell assets for less than market value  
- Independent valuation required for major transactions  
- CIC Regulator must approve certain disposals  
- Assets must remain for community benefit or transfer to another CIC/charity

**Practical Impact on Investment:**

- Strategic acquisition: Possible but requires a mission-aligned buyer  
- Traditional VC "flip": Difficult/impossible under CIC structure  
- Long-term hold: Ideal structure for patient capital  
- Dividend focus: Best return mechanism given constraints

**Investor Profile Match:**

- ✅ Impact investors (patient capital, mission alignment)  
- ✅ Family offices (long-term orientation)  
- ✅ Strategic corporates (interested in protocol ecosystem)  
- ✅ Ethical investment funds (ESG mandates)  
- ❌ Traditional VC funds (5-7 year horizons, 10x+ targets)  
- ❌ Growth equity (rapid scale expectations)

### Open-Source Foundation

MIT-licensed core (contracts, ZK circuits) ensures transparency and auditability. Managed apps offer user-friendly access, as exemplified by Signal's model.

### Diversified Revenue Model

- **Free Tier (95-97% Users):** Unlimited tracking, proofs, and payouts—zero barriers.  
- **Premium (£7/month, 3-8% Conversion):** Backups, advanced analytics, priority features.  
- **Developer APIs:** Tiered pricing from free to enterprise.  
- **Marketplace Commissions (30%):** On data sales.

## Financial Model

### Value Tier Economics (Monthly, Per Active Marketplace User)

**Methodology:** Based on comparable privacy-respecting data markets, buyer willingness to pay for verified vs. inferred data, and realistic fraud rates of 5-8%.

| Value Tiers | % of Active Users | Gross Value to Buyers | User Earnings (70%) | Olocus Commission (30%) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Tier 1: Passive Background Data | 70% | £0.30-0.50 (avg £0.40) | £0.28 | £0.12 |
| Tier 2: Occasional Proof Generation | 25% | £1.50-3.00 (avg £2.25) | £1.58 | £0.68 |
| Tier 3: High-Value Verified behaviours | 4% | £8-15 (avg £11.50) | £8.05 | £3.45 |
| Tier 4: Power Users / Complex Proofs | 1% | £30-60 (avg £45) | £31.50 | £13.50 |

**Weighted Averages (Per Active Marketplace User):**

- **Gross marketplace value:** £1.62/month  
  - Calculation: (0.70 × £0.40) \+ (0.25 × £2.25) \+ (0.04 × £11.50) \+ (0.01 × £45) \= £1.62  
- **User earnings (70%):** £1.13/month  
  - Calculation: (0.70 × £0.28) \+ (0.25 × £1.58) \+ (0.04 × £8.05) \+ (0.01 × £31.50) \= £1.13  
- **Olocus commission (30%):** £0.49/month  
  - Calculation: (0.70 × £0.12) \+ (0.25 × £0.68) \+ (0.04 × £3.45) \+ (0.01 × £13.50) \= £0.49  
  - Verification: £1.62 × 0.30 \= £0.486 ≈ £0.49 ✓

**Annual per active user:**

- Olocus marketplace commission: £0.49 × 12 \= **£5.88/year**  
- User earnings: £1.13 × 12 \= **£13.56/year**

**Tier distribution explanation:**

- **Tier 1 (70%):** Casual users, minimal co-signing, basic location proofs  
- **Tier 2 (25%):** Regular users, some co-signing, occasional verified claims  
- **Tier 3 (4%):** Engaged users, frequent co-signing, valuable verified behaviours (fitness, commute patterns)  
- **Tier 4 (1%):** Power users, extensive verification history, complex multi-dimensional proofs

### Why Buyers Pay Premium

**PRICING RATIONALE:**

Traditional data brokers: 60-70% accuracy, £2-5/user/year Olocus verified data: 92-95% accuracy, £8-20/user/year Premium justified: 2-4x (not 10-20x)

**Buyer Economics:**

**Case Study 1 \- Fitness Insurance:**

- Traditional: Self-reported gym visits (70% accuracy due to overreporting)  
- Olocus: Verified 4+ visits/week (92-95% accuracy)  
- Insurance company willing to pay: £15-20/year per verified user  
- User tier placement: Tier 3 (avg £11.50/month gross \= £138/year)  
- **Reality check:** Insurance company can buy at £15/year via bulk contract, individual user gets £10.50/year share

**Case Study 2 \- Transit Verification for Carbon Credits:**

- Traditional: Self-reported commute mode (60% accuracy)  
- Olocus: Verified public transit usage (90-95% accuracy)  
- Corporate ESG program willing to pay: £8-12/year per verified commuter  
- User tier placement: Tier 2 (avg £2.25/month gross \= £27/year)  
- **Reality check:** Bulk corporate contract at £10/year, user gets £7/year share

**Case Study 3 \- Background Check Alternative:**

- Traditional: Self-reported work history (needs manual verification, £50-100)  
- Olocus: Verified work location pattern over 6-12 months  
- Employer willing to pay: £20-30 one-time verification  
- User tier placement: Tier 3-4 (one-time, not recurring)

**Key Insight:** Buyers will pay a premium for accuracy, but our original 10-20x projection was unrealistic—realistic premium: 2-4x over data brokers.

## Why Distributed Architecture \= Lean Economics

**Traditional Data Company (e.g., fitness tracking app):**

- Stores all user data centrally → massive database costs  
- Processes all analytics server-side → huge compute costs  
- Serves billions of API requests → expensive infrastructure  
- 24/7 reliability requirements → large DevOps team  
- **Result:** Need 100+ engineers at 1M users, £15-25M/year infrastructure

**Olocus Distributed Protocol:**

- Data stored on-device → zero database costs for user data  
- ZKPs generated on-device → zero compute costs for proof generation  
- Blockchain only for timestamps → £200-300K/year for 1M users  
- Marketplace/API as thin coordination layer → modest server requirements  
- **Result:** 35-40 people at 1M users, £4-5M/year total costs

**The Math:**

- Personnel savings: £6-10M/year (60-70 fewer engineers)  
- Infrastructure savings: £10-20M/year (no data processing/storage at scale)  
- **Total structural advantage: £16-30M/year at 1M users**

This is the core insight: By pushing computation and storage to the edge (i.e., user devices), we achieve both better privacy and better economics. It's not a tradeoff—it's a win-win enabled by cryptography (ZKPs) and modern mobile hardware.

However, this comes with a cost: an **8-10% daily battery drain** initially limits mainstream adoption. We accept this tradeoff, targeting power users and privacy advocates in the early years while aggressively optimising.

---

## Technical Architecture: Hybrid for Scale and Privacy

### Core Design Principles

- **On-Device Core:** Hash chains store data locally, with ZKPs generated client-side.  
- **Blockchain Anchoring:** Daily batch to L2 (Polkadot) for timestamps—at negligible cost.  
- **Payments:** Hybrid fiat/crypto for accessibility.  
- **Centralised Services:** UX-focused (marketplace, verification) for speed, with decentralisation on data/trust.

This avoids the pitfalls of a complete blockchain (high costs, poor UX) and the risks of centralisation (data honeypots), delivering 90% of the decentralisation benefits at 10% of the complexity.

### Battery Impact Assessment

**TECHNICAL REALITY:**

**Component Battery Costs:**

1. **Continuous location tracking:** 3-5% daily  
     
   - Background GPS (significant-location-changes mode)  
   - WiFi scanning for precision  
   - Cell tower triangulation

   

2. **On-device data processing:** 1-2% daily  
     
   - Hash chain updates  
   - Place identification  
   - Behavioural heuristics

   

3. **ZKP generation:** 3-4% daily  
     
   - Tier 1-2 proofs: 1-2% (simple circuits)  
   - Tier 3-4 proofs: 3-5% (complex circuits)  
   - Average across user base: \~3-4%

   

4. **Blockchain sync & networking:** 0.5-1% daily  
     
   - Daily anchor submission  
   - Co-signing coordination  
   - Marketplace transactions

**Total battery impact: 8-10% daily**

**Comparison Benchmarks:**

- Google Maps (active navigation): 15-25% per hour  
- Strava (active tracking): 10-15% per hour  
- Google Timeline (passive): 5-8% daily  
- Life360 (passive family tracking): 10-15% daily  
- **Olocus (passive \+ ZKPs): 8-10% daily**

**User Tolerance Analysis:**

- \<5% daily: Widely acceptable (90%+ users)  
- 5-8% daily: Acceptable to engaged users (60-70% users)  
- 8-10% daily: Acceptable to power users only (30-40% users)  
- 10% daily: Deal-breaker for mainstream (only 10-20% willing)

**Strategic Implications:**

**Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Embrace Power User Market**

- Target early adopters who value privacy and are willing to pay battery cost  
- Premium devices (iPhone 13+, Samsung S21+) have sufficient battery capacity  
- Focus on high-value use cases (fitness tracking, professional verification)  
- **Expected adoption ceiling: \~50-100K users before battery becomes primary barrier**

**Phase 2 (Years 3-5): Aggressive Optimisation**

- Native module development (reduce overhead)  
- Custom ZK circuits (50-70% faster proof generation)  
- Adaptive tracking (reduce GPS frequency in low-value scenarios)  
- Smart scheduling (defer processing to charging periods)  
- **Target: Reduce to 5-7% daily battery impact**

**Phase 3 (Years 5-10): Mainstream Readiness**

- Hardware acceleration for ZKPs (secure enclaves, dedicated chips)  
- Tiered tracking modes (light/medium/full)  
- User controls for battery vs. accuracy tradeoffs  
- **Target: Reduce to 3-5% daily for "light mode"**

**Assessment:** We will be a "power user" product for the first 3-5 years. Mainstream adoption requires significant battery optimisation and/or hardware improvements. This is acceptable—many successful products (Strava, Life360) started with engaged niches.

---

### ZKP Implementation

ZKPs enable verification without revelation. On-device generation utilises tiered complexity, incorporating optimisations such as recursion and Merkle trees. For edge cases, optional enclave offloading maintains privacy. Libraries like SnarkJS ensure mobile viability.

#### Mobile ZKP Performance: Benchmarks

**Test devices:** iPhone 13 Pro / Samsung S21  
**Library:** SnarkJS (Groth16) with Circom  
**Reality check:** These are OPTIMISTIC benchmarks from our lab testing. Real-world performance will be 20-30% slower due to background processes, device age, and thermal throttling.

| Tier | Example | Circuit Size | Proof Generation | Battery Impact | Real-World Frequency |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Tier 1: Simple Binary Claims | "Within 100m of GPS coordinate" | \~10K constraints | 1.5-3s | 0.02% per proof | 1-3 times/day |
| Tier 2: Basic Aggregation | "Visited location 4+ times this week" | \~100K | 15-45s | 0.15% per proof | 1-2 times/week |
| Tier 3: Medium Complexity | "Gym 30+ times/90 days, 3+ co-signs" | \~500K | 60-180s | 0.5-1% per proof | 1-2 times/month |
| Tier 4: Complex Historical | "90% public transit over 12 months" | \>2M constraints | Not on-device | N/A | Delegated to server (with privacy preservation) |

**Daily battery impact from ZKP generation:**

- Tier 1 users (70% of active): 2 proofs/day × 0.02% \= 0.04% daily  
- Tier 2 users (25% of active): 0.3 proofs/day × 0.15% \= 0.045% daily  
- Tier 3 users (4% of active): 0.07 proofs/day × 0.75% \= 0.05% daily  
- Tier 4 users (1% of active): Server-side, minimal battery impact  
- **Weighted average: \~3-4% daily for ZKP generation across user base**

**Accuracy Methodology:**

- GPS/sensor fusion: 85-90% base accuracy  
- Behavioural heuristics: \+5-7% (detect impossible movements, temporal patterns)  
- Social verification (co-signing): \+3-5% (multi-party confirmation)  
- **Target accuracy: 92-95% for co-signed proofs, 85-90% for solo proofs**

**Known Limitations:**

- Indoor accuracy: 75-85% (GPS drift, WiFi dependency)  
- Rural areas: 80-90% (fewer WiFi signals, cell towers)  
- Underground/tunnels: 60-70% (GPS unavailable)  
- Non-co-signed proofs: 85-90% (lacks social verification layer)

**Fraud Reality Check:** With 8-10% daily battery drain creating friction, the fraud incentive is lower than initially feared. However, if users can earn £50-200/year, determined fraudsters will attempt:

- GPS spoofing (1-2% of users, mitigated by device integrity checks)  
- Multiple devices (2-4% of users, mitigated by behavioural analysis and economic disincentives)  
- Coordinated fraud rings (2-4% of users, mitigated by graph analysis)  
- **Expected fraud rate: 5-8% initially, improving to 3-5% with ML at scale**

---

## Co-Signing Security Model & Attack Mitigation

Co-signing is fraud-resistant but not fraud-proof. We target 5-8% fraudulent proofs initially, improving to 3-5% with ML at scale.

| Attack Vector | Scenario | Mitigations | Expected Fraud Rate | Cost to Execute |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Single User, Multiple Devices | Carry 2-3 phones to fake co-signs | Device fingerprinting, behavioural heuristics, economic disincentives (stake/reputation), temporal impossibility detection | 2-4% | Low (£200-400 in cheap Android devices) |
| Coordinated Fraud Rings | Group of users fake co-signs remotely | Location cross-validation (must be physically possible), timing analysis (coordination leaves patterns), graph analysis (fraud rings form clusters), social penalties (ban entire ring) | 3-5% | Medium (requires 3-10 people, coordination overhead) |
| GPS Spoofing | Rooted device fakes location | Device integrity checks (SafetyNet/Play Integrity on Android, DeviceCheck on iOS), sensor fusion validation (accelerometer/gyroscope must match movement), behavioural impossibilities (can't teleport), confidence scoring (flag suspicious patterns) | 1-2% | Medium-High (technical skill, detection risk) |
| Sybil Attack (Mass Fake Accounts) | Create hundreds of fake users | Blockchain anchoring (costs to create accounts), proof-of-work on registration, social graph analysis (fake accounts have distinct patterns), gradual privilege escalation (new users have lower trust) | \<1% | High (doesn't scale economically) |

**Layered Defence Strategy:**

**Layer 1: Technical Prevention**

- Device fingerprinting (detect multiple accounts from the same device)  
- Location cross-validation (WiFi, cell towers, GPS must align)  
- Sensor fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, validate movement)  
- Timing analysis (detect coordination patterns)

**Layer 2: Economic Disincentives**

- Staking requirement for high-value proofs (£10-50 stake, slashed if fraud is detected)  
- Reputation system (fraudulent proofs permanently reduce earning potential)  
- Tiered trust (new users earn less until proven reliable)

**Layer 3: Social Verification**

- Co-signing creates mutual accountability  
- Graph analysis detects fraud rings  
- Community reporting (users can flag suspicious behaviour)

**Layer 4: Machine Learning (Post-Launch)**

- Behavioural pattern recognition  
- Anomaly detection (impossible movements, statistical outliers)  
- Network analysis (fraud rings form identifiable clusters)  
- Continuous model updates based on confirmed fraud

**Transparency & Continuous Improvement:**

- Quarterly fraud reports (public disclosure of fraud rates)  
- Bug bounties (£500-5K for novel attack discoveries)  
- Third-party security audits (annual)  
- Open-source core (community can review and improve)

**Assessment:** The initial 5-8% fraud rate is realistic for privacy-preserving systems. Traditional background checks have a 2-3% fraud rate, but they often rely on invasive identity verification methods. Our privacy-first approach accepts a slightly higher risk of fraud in exchange for user sovereignty.

## User Experience: Seamless and Inclusive

**Onboarding:**

- Time: 30-60 seconds (not 30 seconds as originally claimed)  
- Steps: App install → Location permission → Background tracking permission → Quick tutorial  
- **Friction point:** Battery permission warning ("This app will use 8-10% daily battery")

**Daily usage:**

- Completely passive for 95% of users  
- No interaction required  
- Background tracking with daily hash chain updates  
- **Friction point:** Notification if battery drain exceeds 12% (user can adjust settings)

**Weekly engagement:**

- Check earnings dashboard (2-5 minutes)  
- Review weekly summary (time allocation, places visited)  
- Optional: Generate proofs for marketplace buyers

**Co-signing experience:**

- **Auto-detected:** When two users are co-located for 5+ minutes, the app prompts "Sign with \[Name\]?"  
- **QR/NFC:** For intentional co-signing (events, meetings)  
- **Friction point:** Requires both users to have the app open simultaneously

**Premium features:**

- Cloud backup of encrypted hash chains  
- Advanced analytics (trends over time, comparisons to past behaviour)  
- Priority marketplace matching  
- Custom proof templates

**Philosophy:** Invisible tech for mainstream; progressive depth for power users. Recognise that an initial 8-10% battery drain limits mainstream adoption.

**UX Assessment:**

- **Great for:** Privacy advocates, power users, data monetisation enthusiasts, people with premium phones  
- **Challenging for:** Battery-conscious users, older phones, users who don't charge daily  
- **Deal-breaker for:** Users who already struggle with battery life, budget phone users (\<£300 devices)

## Competitive Analysis & Differentiation

| Competitor | Strengths | Why We're Different | Our Moat | Assessment |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Google Timeline/Apple Maps | Billions of users, seamless UX, excellent battery optimisation | They monetise user data without compensation; no portability/ZKPs; no user control | User ownership, cryptographic proof, monetisation, open protocol | **Threat:** If Google adds a "share verified location for cash" feature, we lose. Must move fast. |
| Life360 | 50M users, strong retention in family safety niche | Surveillance model; no cryptographic proofs; limited monetization | Privacy-preserving, broader use cases, user sovereignty | **Advantage:** Different target market (individuals vs families). Complementary? |
| Data Brokers (Acxiom, Experian) | Established buyers, massive scale, deep integration | 60-70% accuracy; no consent; regulatory risk | 92-95% accuracy, explicit consent, user compensation, regulatory compliance | **Reality:** They have entrenched relationships. We need to prove value to buyers. |
| Proof of Humanity / Worldcoin | Decentralised identity, crypto-native | One-time verification; no continuous behaviours; invasive (iris scans) | Continuous proofs, location-based trust graph, privacy-preserving | **Advantage:** We complement them (they prove "unique human", we prove "human behaviours"). |
| Fitness Apps (Strava, Nike Run Club) | Engaged users, vertical-specific network effects | Narrow use case; no monetization; no cryptographic proofs | General-purpose infrastructure, verified proofs, monetization | **Reality:** Strava has 100M users. We won't displace them. We enable them (API integration). |
| Web3 Social (Lens, Farcaster) | Decentralized, crypto-native | No real-world verification; Sybil vulnerable; complex UX | Physical co-signing, Sybil-resistant, accessible | **Opportunity:** We're the "real-world verification layer" for Web3 social. |

**Win Condition:** We don't need to beat all competitors. We need to:

1. Reach 200-500K users before Google clones us (5-7 years)  
2. Establish developer ecosystem (APIs become standard)  
3. Build a buyer network that values our privacy approach  
4. Create an open protocol that others build on (network effects)

**Risk Factors:**

- Google adds verified location sharing: 60% risk, would accelerate timeline  
- Regulatory ban on passive tracking: 10-15% risk, would be existential  
- Battery tech doesn't improve: 20% risk, would cap growth at 500K users  
- Buyers don't materialise: 30% risk, would require pivot to pure API play

**Blue Ocean Opportunity:** Verified data \+ privacy \+ user compensation is genuinely novel. No one is doing all three at the same time. Market window: 5-10 years before big tech clones it.

**Target:** 2M users (0.5% of 400M addressable market) by Year 15\. This is achievable and defensible.

## Regulatory Landscape & Compliance Strategy

Location data is personal data under GDPR/CCPA: Requires explicit consent, minimisation, deletion rights, and purpose limitation.

**Compliance Strategy:**

- **On-device processing:** Data never leaves the user device unless explicit consent for specific proof  
- **Granular controls:** Users choose what to track, what to prove, what to sell  
- **Right to be forgotten:** Full data deletion in \<30 days  
- **Purpose limitation:** Each buyer interaction requires explicit consent  
- **k-anonymity:** Minimum buyer pool size to prevent re-identification  
- **Data minimisation:** Only generate proofs for what's needed (not full location history)

**Regulatory Challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Location Tracking Perception**

- Risk: Seen as a "surveillance app" despite a privacy-preserving design  
- Mitigation: Clear communication, opt-in only, visible controls, CIC structure signals intent  
- Probability: 40-50% we face PR challenges

**Challenge 2: Age Verification Liability**

- Risk: If we're used for age verification, we're liable if we fail to detect minors  
- Mitigation: Supplement other methods (not primary), confidence scores, and disclaim liability  
- Probability: 20-30%. This becomes an issue if we pursue the age verification use case

**Challenge 3: Cross-Border Data Transfer**

- Risk: GDPR restricts data transfer outside the EU, complicating global scaling  
- Mitigation: On-device processing means no transfer, blockchain anchoring uses non-PII hashes  
- Probability: 10-15% this becomes a technical challenge

**Challenge 4: Insurance/Financial Services Regulation**

- Risk: If we're used for credit scoring or insurance, we're subject to additional regulation  
- Mitigation: API licensing model (buyers handle regulatory compliance), clear ToS  
- Probability: 30-40% we face additional compliance requirements

**Jurisdictional Strategy:**

- **Primary markets:** UK, EU (strong privacy laws, supportive)  
- **Secondary markets:** Australia, Canada (moderate regulation)  
- **Tertiary markets:** US (patchwork state laws, manage carefully)  
- **Excluded markets:** China (incompatible with our model)

**Legal Budget:**

- Year 1-3: £50-100K/year (foundational advice)  
- Year 4-7: £150-250K/year (scaling compliance)  
- Year 8+: £300-500K/year (multi-jurisdictional, specialised counsel)

**Regulatory Risk Assessment:**

- 70% probability: Smooth operation with normal compliance overhead  
- 20% probability: Moderate challenges requiring product changes (e.g., restrict certain proof types)  
- 10% probability: Major challenges requiring pivot or geographic restriction

**Reality Check:** Location tracking is a politically sensitive issue. We will face scrutiny. The CIC structure helps, but it doesn't eliminate risk.

## Go-to-Market: Sequential Beachhead Strategy

**Philosophy:** Build density in niches before scaling horizontally. Network effects require geographic clustering.

### Phase 1: University Campuses (Months 1-18, Target 500-5K users)

**Why this works:**

- High density for co-signing  
- Tech-savvy early adopters  
- Low customer acquisition cost  
- Natural viral loops (friends, classes, social events)

**Tactics:**

- **Campus ambassadors:** £200-500/month per campus, 3-5 campuses  
- **Campus events:** Sponsor 10-20 events (£500-2K per event)  
- **Student competitions:** "Most co-signs wins £5K" style contests  
- **Course integration:** Partner with computer science/privacy courses

**Budget:** £40-80K over 18 months **Target CAC:** £10-20 per user **Expected outcome:** 2-5K users, 30-35% D30 retention

**Challenges:**

- **Battery drain:** Students may not tolerate 8-10% drain  
- **Graduation churn:** Users leave campus, activity drops  
- **Limited earnings:** Students have a low willingness to sell data

**Mitigation:**

- Focus on privacy-conscious CS students (higher tolerance)  
- Alumni retention program (keep using for professional verification)  
- Emphasise life-logging, not earnings, for students

### Phase 2: Fitness Communities (Months 12-36, Target 10K-50K users)

**Why this works:**

- Recurring co-signing at the exact location (gyms, studios)  
- Strong incentive alignment (insurance discounts, personal tracking)  
- Community-oriented users (willing to share/co-sign)  
- Natural buyer market (fitness insurance, wellness programs)

**Tactics:**

- **Gym partnerships:** £1-2K/month per gym for promotion (10-20 gyms)  
- **Fitness influencers:** £500-2K per campaign (15-30 influencers)  
- **Gym competitions:** "Fittest gym wins £10K" (measured by verified activity)  
- **Insurance pilot:** Partner with 2-3 fitness insurance providers

**Budget:** £150-300K over 24 months **Target CAC:** £20-40 per user **Expected outcome:** 20-50K users, 35-40% D30 retention, first meaningful marketplace revenue

**Challenges:**

- **Gym tracking perception:** May seem like surveillance  
- **Battery drain:** Fitness users already use tracking apps (Strava), compounding drain  
- **Limited gym adoption:** Many gyms reluctant to promote apps

**Mitigation:**

- Emphasise insurance discounts (tangible benefit)  
- Partner with gym chains (not independent gyms)  
- Optimise battery during workouts (reduce tracking frequency indoors)

### Phase 3: Sustainability/Transit Community (Months 24-48, Target 50K-100K users)

**Why this works:**

- Growing corporate ESG demand  
- Government incentives for carbon reduction  
- Recurring patterns (daily commute)  
- Buyer liquidity (corporate carbon credits)

**Tactics:**

- **Transit agency partnerships:** Subsidised transit passes for verified users (£5-10/month credit)  
- **Corporate ESG programs:** B2B deals with 10-20 corporations (£10-50K per pilot)  
- **Environmental NGO partnerships:** Co-marketing with climate organizations  
- **Government grants:** Apply for green tech / smart city funding

**Budget:** £200-400K over 24 months **Target CAC:** £15-30 per user **Expected outcome:** 30-80K users, 30-35% D30 retention, strong B2B traction

**Challenges:**

- **Public transit tracking accuracy:** Underground, tunnels cause gaps  
- **User ambivalence:** Many don't care about carbon tracking  
- **Corporate sales cycle:** Long (9-18 months), resource-intensive

**Mitigation:**

- Focus on above-ground transit initially (buses, trams)  
- Target sustainability-conscious demographic (overlap with early adopters)  
- Hire dedicated B2B salesperson (Month 18-24)

### Phase 4: Mainstream Expansion (Months 36-72, Target 100K-350K users)

**Why this works:**

- Network effects kicking in (density in 3-5 cities)  
- Proven value proposition (marketplace earnings visible)  
- Diversified buyer base (insurance, finance, research)

**Tactics:**

- **Paid acquisition:** Facebook, Instagram, Google Ads (£500K-1.5M over 36 months)  
- **Referral program:** £10 bonus per successful referral  
- **PR campaign:** Launch "privacy-preserving data economy" narrative  
- **API developer outreach:** Target 20-50 apps to integrate

**Budget:** £1.2-2.5M over 36 months **Target CAC:** £25-50 per user (higher due to paid channels) **Expected outcome:** 200-350K users by Month 72, approaching profitability

**Challenges:**

- **Battery drain still an issue:** Mainstream users less tolerant  
- **Competition:** Google or Apple may have cloned by now  
- **Acquisition efficiency:** Paid channels have higher CAC, lower retention

**Mitigation:**

- Focus on iOS users first (better battery life, higher willingness to pay)  
- Aggressive battery optimisation (must be \<7% daily by this phase)  
- Emphasise open protocol (can't be shut down by big tech)

### Phase 5: International & API Scaling (Years 6-10, Target 350K-2M users)

**Why this works:**

- Established proof points (UK/EU success)  
- Developer ecosystem mature (10-20 integrated apps)  
- Geographic expansion (Australia, Canada, US)

**Tactics:**

- **Localisation:** Support 5-10 languages, local payment methods  
- **Regional partnerships:** Replicate gym/transit partnerships in new markets  
- **API marketplace:** Enable third-party developers to build on the protocol  
- **Enterprise licensing:** B2B contracts with large platforms

**Budget:** £2-4M over 60 months **Target CAC:** £20-40 per user (efficiency from organic growth) **Expected outcome:** 1-2M users by Year 10, sustainable profitability

### Total 10-Year Go-to-Market Budget

| Phase | Duration | Budget | Target Users | Blended CAC |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Phase 1: Universities | Months 1-18 | £60K | 2-5K | £12-30 |
| Phase 2: Fitness | Months 12-36 | £225K | 20-50K | £20-40 |
| Phase 3: Sustainability | Months 24-48 | £300K | 30-80K | £15-30 |
| Phase 4: Mainstream | Months 36-72 | £2M | 200-350K | £25-50 |
| Phase 5: International | Years 6-10 | £3M | 1-2M | £20-40 |
| **Total** | **10 years** | **£5.6M** | **1-2M users** | **£28-40 avg** |

**Note:** These budgets are IN ADDITION to core team costs (engineering, operations). This is pure customer acquisition spend.

---

## Core Team (Lean Protocol Organisation)

**Philosophy:** Distributed infrastructure \= minimal centralized team. Most computation is done on-device, most storage is on-device, and blockchain is used for anchoring only. However, fraud prevention, customer support, and sales require MORE people than originally projected.

**Year 1-2 Team (5-8 people):**

- CEO (Mark Harper) \- business/regulatory/fundraising  
- CIO (Andre Perry) \- technical architecture  
- Senior Mobile Engineer (cross-platform, React Native/Flutter)  
- Cryptography Engineer (contract/part-time, ZKP circuits)  
- Product Designer (UX/UI)  
- Business Development (marketplace/buyers, contract)  
- DevOps Engineer (contract/part-time, blockchain integration)  
- Community Manager (contract/part-time, user support)

**Budget:** £400-600K/year (Year 1), £600-800K/year (Year 2\)

**Year 3-5 Team (12-18 people):**

- Core team above (8 FTE)  
- \+2 Mobile engineers (separate iOS/Android optimisation)  
- \+2 Backend engineers (marketplace, APIs, fraud detection)  
- \+1 Data scientist (fraud ML, behavioural analysis)  
- \+2 Customer success (marketplace buyers, enterprise API)  
- \+1 Marketing lead (paid acquisition, PR)  
- \+1 Legal/compliance specialist (GDPR, multi-jurisdiction)

**Budget:** £1.2-1.8M/year

**Year 6-10 Team (25-45 people):**

**Engineering (14-18):**

- Mobile: 6 (iOS, Android, battery optimisation)  
- Backend: 4 (marketplace, APIs, infrastructure)  
- Cryptography: 2 (ZKP optimisation, security)  
- Security/Fraud: 2 (ML, graph analysis)  
- DevOps: 2 (blockchain, infrastructure)

**Product/Design (3-5):**

- Product managers: 2  
- Designers: 2-3

**Business Development (6-10):**

- Enterprise API sales: 3-4  
- Marketplace buyer success: 2-3  
- Partnerships: 2-3

**Operations (5-8):**

- Legal/compliance: 2-3  
- Finance: 1-2  
- HR/Recruiting: 1-2  
- Executive assistant: 1

**Support/Community (3-5):**

- Community managers: 2-3  
- User support: 2-3 (rotational, mostly contractors)

**Budget:** £2.5-4M/year (Year 6-7), £3.5-5M/year (Year 8-10)

**Comparable Lean Teams:**

- Signal: \~40 people for 100M+ users (but nonprofit, less fraud complexity)  
- Telegram: \~30 engineers for 700M+ users (but Russian dev costs)  
- WhatsApp: \~50 engineers for 900M users (acquired pre-fraud era)  
- **Olocus:** 35-45 people for 1M users is realistic, given fraud prevention and marketplace complexity

**Why More People Than Original Projection:**

1. **Fraud is hard:** Need dedicated data science \+ security team (5-7 people)  
2. **Customer support:** 1M users \= 5-10K monthly support tickets (3-5 people)  
3. **Enterprise sales:** API revenue requires dedicated sales (3-4 people)  
4. **Legal complexity:** Multi-jurisdiction, sensitive data (2-3 people)

- **Note:** At this stage, the company may choose to remain private and return capital via dividends rather than raising.

---

### Total Capital Raised: £25-60M Over 10 Years

**Conservative path:** £25-35M (if growth is slower, less capital needed) **Base case:** £35-45M **Aggressive path:** £50-60M (if growth faster, international expansion)

**Cumulative dilution:** 55-65% (founders retain 35-45% after all rounds)

---

### Investment Return Scenarios (10-15 Year Horizon)

**Scenario 1: Dividend-Focused Hold (Most Likely)**

**Year 10 Status:**

- 1M users  
- £7.9M annual revenue  
- £3M annual profit  
- Dividend payout: £300-450K/year (10-15% of profit)

**Year 15 Status:**

- 2.5M users  
- £22.3M annual revenue  
- £15.2M annual profit  
- Dividend payout: £1.5-2.3M/year

**Investor returns (Series A investor, £10M at £40M post-money valuation):**

- Ownership: 25%  
- Annual dividend (Year 10-15 avg): £450K/year × 25% \= £112.5K/year  
- 10-year cumulative dividends: £1.1M (11% return on initial investment)  
- Plus: Company worth £40-80M in Year 15, 25% stake worth £10-20M  
- **Total return: 2.1-3.1x over 10-15 years (\~7-10% IRR)**

**Note:** This is GOOD for impact investing, but LOW for traditional VC.

---

**Scenario 2: Strategic Acquisition (Secondary Outcome)**

**Year 8 Acquisition:**

- 500K users  
- £3.4M annual revenue (conservative path)  
- Valuation: 2-3x revenue \= £7-10M  
- **Reality check:** Asset lock \+ CIC constraints \= limited buyer pool

**Investor returns (Series A investor, £10M at £40M post-money):**

- Ownership: 25%  
- Sale proceeds: £7-10M × 25% \= £1.75-2.5M  
- **Loss on initial investment:** \-£7.5-8.25M  
- **NOT VIABLE for traditional VC**

**HOWEVER:** If we hit the optimistic path:

**Year 10 Acquisition:**

- 2M users  
- £18M annual revenue (optimistic path)  
- Valuation: 2.5-3x revenue \= £45-54M  
- CIC-compliant buyer (privacy-focused platform)

**Investor returns (Series A investor, £10M at £40M post-money):**

- Ownership: 25% (diluted from subsequent rounds to \~18%)  
- Sale proceeds: £45-54M × 18% \= £8.1-9.7M  
- **Loss/slight gain: \-£0.3M to \-£1.9M or \+£0-0.3M**  
- **Still not great for VC, but acceptable for an impact investor**

---

**Scenario 3: Token Launch \+ Dividend Hybrid (Aspirational)**

**Year 6-8 Token Launch:**

- Governance token for protocol decisions  
- Shareholders receive proportional allocation (e.g., 30% of token supply)  
- Token market cap: £50-150M (speculative, depends on crypto market)

**Investor returns (Series A investor, £10M at £40M post-money):**

- Ownership: 20% (post-dilution)  
- Token allocation: £50-150M × 30% shareholder pool × 20% \= £3-9M  
- Plus: Ongoing dividends (£300-600K cumulative by Year 10\)  
- Plus: Retained equity stake  
- **Potential total return: 1.5-3x over 8-10 years**

**Note:** Highly speculative, depends on the crypto market and community adoption of the token.

---

### Summary: Investment Return Expectations

**For Traditional VC:**

- Expected return: 0.8-2x over 10 years  
- **Verdict:** NOT SUITABLE (VCs target 5-10x)

**For Impact Investors / Family Offices:**

- Expected return: 2-3x over 10-15 years via dividends \+ modest exit  
- Social impact: Open-source privacy infrastructure, user data sovereignty  
- **Verdict:** ATTRACTIVE (7-10% IRR \+ mission alignment)\*\*

**For Strategic Corporations:**

- Strategic value: Access to verified data protocol, integration with existing products  
- Financial return: Secondary to strategic benefits  
- **Verdict:** ATTRACTIVE (if it fits strategic priorities)

**Reality Check:** This is NOT a "flip to big tech for £500M" opportunity. This is a "build sustainable, profitable infrastructure that generates long-term returns and a genuine social good" opportunity.

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Battery Drain Unacceptable to Mainstream**

- Probability: 40-50%  
- Impact: Caps growth at 100-300K power users  
- Mitigation:  
  - Aggressive optimisation roadmap (target \<5% by Year 5\)  
  - Tiered tracking modes (light/medium/full)  
  - Hardware partnerships (lobby for ZK acceleration)  
- Contingency: Pivot to "event-only" tracking (lower battery, less value)

**Risk 2: ZKP Performance Can't Scale**

- Probability: 20-30%  
- Impact: Complex proofs (Tier 3-4) remain slow/infeasible  
- Mitigation:  
  - Incremental improvements (Phase 1-3 optimisation)  
  - Hybrid approach (simple proofs on-device, complex server-side)  
  - Alternative crypto (explore non-ZK privacy tech)  
- Contingency: Focus on simple proofs only (Tier 1-2), less buyer value

**Risk 3: Location Accuracy Insufficient**

- Probability: 20-30%  
- Impact: Buyer confidence erodes, marketplace revenue is limited  
- Mitigation:  
  - Multi-modal verification (GPS \+ WiFi \+ cell \+ sensors)  
  - Co-signing layer (social proof)  
  - Confidence scoring (disclose accuracy to buyers)  
- Contingency: Focus on "good enough" use cases (presence verification, not precision)

---

### Market Risks

**Risk 4: Buyers Don't Materialise**

- Probability: 30-40%  
- Impact: Marketplace revenue stalls, user earnings disappoint  
- Mitigation:  
  - Diversified buyer outreach (insurance, finance, research, ESG)  
  - Pilot programs (subsidise early buyers to prove value)  
  - API pivot (sell infrastructure, not data)  
- Contingency: Pivot to pure B2B API business (Sybil resistance, reputation scoring)

**Risk 5: Users Won't Tolerate Passive Tracking**

- Probability: 30-40%  
- Impact: Acquisition stalls, retention is poor  
- Mitigation:  
  - Transparency (show exactly what's tracked)  
  - Granular controls (pause, delete, selective sharing)  
  - Clear value proposition (£20-200/year earnings \+ life logging)  
- Contingency: Pivot to "opt-in only" tracking (events, activities, not continuous)

**Risk 6: Competition from Big Tech**

- Probability: 50-60% (Google or Apple clones in 5-7 years)  
- Impact: Mainstream adoption is difficult, relegated to a niche  
- Mitigation:  
  - First-mover advantage (build network effects fast)  
  - Open protocol (can't be shut down)  
  - Privacy differentiation (they can't match CIC structure)  
  - Developer ecosystem (lock-in via integrations)  
- Contingency: Position as "privacy alternative" niche, accept smaller TAM

---

### Regulatory Risks

**Risk 7: Passive Tracking Banned or Heavily Restricted**

- Probability: 10-15%  
- Impact: Existential (can't operate in major markets)  
- Mitigation:  
  - Multi-jurisdiction strategy (don't rely on one market)  
  - Lobbying/industry groups (privacy-preserving tech advocacy)  
  - Geographic flexibility (exit hostile jurisdictions)  
- Contingency: Pivot to "event-only" tracking, or wind down

---

### Combined Risk Assessment

**Probability of "Total Success" (2M+ users, £15M+ profit by Year 15):**

- 15-25%

**Probability of "Moderate Success" (500K-1M users, £3-8M profit by Year 12):**

- 30-40%

**Probability of "Slow Build" (200-500K users, break-even by Year 10):**

- 25-35%

**Probability of "Failure" (shut down or pivot within 5-7 years):**

- 20-30%

**Key Risk Factors:**

1. Battery drain limits mainstream adoption (40-50% probability)  
2. Buyers don't materialise at scale (30-40% probability)  
3. Big tech clones us (50-60% probability, but not fatal if we move fast)  
4. Regulatory hostility (10-15% existential, 25-35% limiting)

**Mitigating Factors:**

1. Distributed architecture \= exceptional unit economics (even at modest scale, profitable)  
2. Open protocol \= can't be shut down, developer ecosystem lock-in  
3. CIC structure \= credible commitment to privacy, differentiation from big tech  
4. Diversified revenue \= not dependent on a single use case

## The Transformative Vision

Olocus isn't an incremental software project \- it's infrastructure for a more equitable internet. But transformation takes time.

**What we're building:**

- Year 1-3: Proof that passive location tracking \+ ZKPs \+ user sovereignty can work  
- Year 4-7: A working marketplace where users earn £20-200/year from their data  
- Year 8-12: An open protocol that developers build on (Sybil resistance, reputation, recovery)  
- Year 13-15: Foundational trust infrastructure for Web3 and beyond

**What we're NOT:**

- A "10x in 5 years" VC play  
- A surveillance company (despite what critics will claim)  
- A replacement for Google Maps (we're infrastructure, not a consumer app)  
- A guaranteed success (this is genuinely hard and uncertain)

**What we need:**

- £35-45M in patient capital over 10 years  
- Investors who understand 7-10% IRR \+ social impact is the goal  
- 8-10 years of runway to reach sustainable profitability  
- Tolerance for technical challenges (battery, fraud, regulation)

**Why this matters:**

- Today: Big tech owns the trust graph, extracts all value, surveils users  
- Tomorrow: Individuals own their trust graph, capture their share, preserve privacy  
- The shift won't happen overnight, but it's worth building toward

**Reality check:** We might build this for 10 years and get acquired by a large US foundation for £60M (modest outcome for investors). Alternatively, we might pioneer a new model and reach 5 million users, generating over £ 50 M in profit by Year 15 (an exceptional outcome). OR we might fail and shut down after 5 years (total loss). All three are possible.

**The bet:** If you believe individuals should own their data, and you're willing to wait 10-15 years for returns, this is the infrastructure to build.

---

## Summary

We're building the trust graph layer for Web3 by solving a fundamental problem: there's no way to verify human relationships and behaviours without centralised surveillance. Physical co-signing creates cryptographically verifiable proof of real-world interactions.

**The Numbers:**

- Year 5: 150K users, still burning cash (£1M/year)  
- Year 7: 350K users, approaching break-even  
- Year 10: 1M users, £7.9M revenue, £3M profit (38% margin)  
- Year 15: 2.5M users, £22.3M revenue, £15.2M profit (68% margin)

**The Timeline:** 8-10 years to profitability, 12-15 years to mature scale.

**The Investment:** £35-45M over 10 years, returns via dividends \+ modest exit.

**The Risk:** 20-30% probability of failure, 50-70% probability of moderate/slow success, 15-25% probability of exceptional outcome.

**The Opportunity:** Build genuine public good infrastructure that happens to be profitable. Shift data economics in favour of individuals. Prove privacy and monetisation can coexist.

**The Catch:** Requires patience, tolerance for uncertainty, and acceptance of moderate (not venture-scale) returns.

**The Question:** Is 2-3x return over 10-15 years \+ genuine social impact worth the risk?

For impact investors, family offices, and strategic corporates: Yes.  
For traditional VC: No.

We're building for the former.

## Appendix B: Innovation Opportunity

**Integrating Federated Machine Learning for Enhanced Trust and Privacy**

Federated learning (“FL”) is a decentralised AI training approach where models are built collaboratively across many devices (like smartphones) without ever sharing the underlying raw data. Instead, each device trains a local model on its own data, then sends only the model updates (e.g., gradients or parameters) to a central server or aggregator. These updates are combined to improve a global model, which is then redistributed for further refinement. This process, pioneered by Google in 2016 for keyboard prediction, ensures privacy by design—raw data never leaves the device, reducing risks of breaches or surveillance.

In Olocus' context, FL could leverage users' on-device location hash chains and sensor data (e.g., from GPS, WiFi, accelerometers) to train models for behavior prediction without centralising sensitive information. For instance:

- **Behavior Prediction:** Models could forecast patterns like daily commutes or gym visits, enhancing personalised analytics (e.g., sustainability metrics or time allocation charts).  
- **Anomaly Detection:** Real-time flagging of irregularities, such as sudden location jumps that might indicate GPS spoofing or fraud rings. Research shows FL excels in IoT environments for this, achieving high accuracy while cutting communication overhead. A systematic review of FL for anomaly detection highlights its use in distributed systems like network traffic or IoT devices, where it maintains privacy and scales to millions of participants. For Olocus, this could reduce fraud rates by incorporating behavioral heuristics, potentially dropping it below 5% through iterative global model updates that learn from aggregated anomalies across the user base.

Integration could start in later phases (e.g., Phase 3 or 4 of Olocus' roadmap, at 75K-1M users), using frameworks like TensorFlow Federated or PySyft. Users would opt-in, earning rewards for contributing model updates, tying into Olocus' marketplace where buyers fund incentives directly.

#### AI-Driven Trust Scoring with Location and Anonymised Patterns

A key innovation opportunity could be "trust scoring"—an AI-generated metric that quantifies a user's behavioral reliability by fusing location data with anonymised sensor patterns, like gait analysis from phone accelerometers and gyroscopes. Gait refers to the unique way a person walks, captured passively via smartphone sensors (e.g., step length, speed, rhythm). This acts as a biometric signal that's hard to fake, adding a layer to Olocus's multi-factor verification (e.g., combining it with co-signing and graph analysis).

- **How It Could Work:** On-device ML could process raw sensor data to extract features (e.g., stride variability), then FL aggregates these across users to refine a global model for scoring. For trust, a score might rate how consistent a user's location claims are with their gait (e.g., detecting if someone is spoofing a gym visit by carrying multiple devices).   
    
- **Olocus Applications:** Proactive alerts for insurance (e.g., verifying fitness for discounts) or security (e.g., digital alibis). If a user's gait deviates anomalously from their location proof, it could trigger a low-trust flag, bolstering Olocus accuracy. Combined with ZKPs, users prove scores (e.g., "trust above 90%") without revealing details, enabling buyers like platforms or researchers to access verified insights compliantly.

This could be a breakthrough for Web3 integrations, solving Sybil attacks by making identities more robust.

#### Expanding to Personalised "Behavioral Twins" with ZKP Privacy

Taking it further, FL could enable "behavioral twins"—AI-powered digital replicas of a user's habits and patterns, simulated on-device for personal insights. Unlike industrial digital twins (e.g., for machines), these are human-centric models that evolve in real-time, offering optimised routines like suggesting eco-friendly commutes based on predicted behaviours.

- **Core Mechanism:** Using FL-trained models, the twin would run simulations on anonymised data (location \+ gait \+ heuristics), generating insights without external data sharing. ZKPs ensure privacy: Users query their twin (e.g., "Simulate my week with less travel") and prove outcomes (e.g., "Reduced carbon footprint by 20%") to buyers or apps.  
    
- **Real-World Parallels and Potential:** [Emerging research](https://www.digitalexperience.live/googles-ai-twins) on human digital twins has shown generative AI to simulate behaviours, with accuracies up to 85% in replicating personalities. A 2025 framework proposes neuro-symbolic AI with ZKP blockchain for patient-owned health twins, creating a marketplace where individuals monetise their models—mirroring Olocus's data economy. In privacy-focused smart cities, digital twins incorporate privacy-enhancing tech like ZKPs to balance utility and data protection.

For Olocus users, this expands value propositions: Power users could earn £200-400/year by selling twin-derived ZKPs (e.g., for job verifications), while maintaining control. Risks like model bias could be mitigated through Olocus's ethical CIC structure, ensuring audits and user governance.

Overall, this integration could position Olocus as a leader in privacy-first AI, driving network effects by making the trust graph smarter and more actionable. It's feasible with current tech but would require R\&D investment in Phases 3-4, potentially yielding breakthroughs in scalable, user-owned AI.

## Appendix C: Other Innovation Opportunities

**Advanced Cryptography and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies**

Beyond the proposed ZKP implementation, Olocus could research and develop next-generation cryptographic methods to enhance privacy and efficiency.

* **Recursive ZKPs and Proof Aggregation**: While mentioned in the context of ZKP implementation, a dedicated R\&D focus on recursive proofs could be a game-changer. This would allow a single, constant-size proof to validate a long chain of historical location data or a complex set of behaviours, dramatically reducing on-device computation and battery drain for complex queries.  
* **Alternative Proof Systems**: Researching post-quantum cryptography or different ZKP schemes (like STARKs, which don't require a trusted setup) could future-proof the protocol and potentially offer performance benefits over the planned Groth16 implementation.  
* **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**: In later stages, exploring FHE could allow the marketplace's coordination layer to perform computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This would provide an even stronger privacy guarantee than ZKPs for certain types of analytics, further reinforcing Olocus's mission.
